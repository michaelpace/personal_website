2015 was a big year for me -- moving twice, getting burgled once, setting foot outside the US for the first times in my life (Mexico in June & Europe in October), switching jobs, and learning how to read.

At the outset of 2016 I find myself in NYC, eager to place roots and grow as a friend, engineer, and creative person. This website will track those efforts and will, in due time, live at a domain that more clearly indicates my name.

This site is built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). You can find its source on [GitHub](https://github.com/michaelpace/personal_website/).
