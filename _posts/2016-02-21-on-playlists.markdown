I'm normally not much of a playlist listener, more often than not preferring to listen to albums front-to-back. I get frustrated at the lack of continuity in many playlists. Still, finding the right album for the moment takes time -- sometimes too much time. I've spent 45 minutes finding the perfect album to cook to, only to be driven outside by my hunger to some grease provider while the groceries inside my apartment frowned and wilted. To avoid that happening in 2016, I've decided to make a few activity-specific playlists. 

My first attempt is [PRO SOFTWARE DEVELOPER PLAYLIST](https://open.spotify.com/user/1271781708/playlist/2VFSsSBQFuOz6KMgXkvpM3) (stay away n00bz). So far, it's 295 songs long and runs for 33 hours.

Finding good programming music is pretty easy -- just check a few boxes:

- no discernable words -- [√]
- very repetitive -- [√]
- few changes of tempo or dynamics -- [√]

Seek music that won't fight for your attention, but will give you an environment in which to think, removed from the physicalness of being and the nagging of any responsibilities you may have. Prefer beats to no beats, and no bass drops to bass drops. The more it sounds like this song, the better:

I'm going to try a cooking playlist next. I've started one ([PRO CHEF PLAYLIST](https://open.spotify.com/user/1271781708/playlist/2GnQnGdNkxxNUgD4woOwMC)) but it's still pretty empty.
