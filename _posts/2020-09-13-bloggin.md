Well, I'm starting a blog. I was browsing the internet on Friday and I thought, "isn't it strange that I don't have a blog?" I've considered maintaining one before for professional reasons, but that's not my motivation here. It's just that I'm 30 now, and why not?

I don't have an audience or subject matter in mind. Jennifer is doing Morning Pages; maybe this is my version of that. Something low-pressure and a bit off-the-cuff. Bam!
